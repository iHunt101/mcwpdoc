To create a new menu :

2. Click on **Create a new menu**, give the menu a name.
3. Now to the left are available menu items that can be added to the screen, check the items you want to add and click on **Add to Menu** button.
4. The items are now added to Menu, you can then sort and lay the menu items in levels by drag and drop.
5. Click on **Save Menu**.

### Dropdown Levels ##

By default Bootstrap supports only single level dropdown. This is keeping in mind various devices that Bootstrap supports. **MediaCenter** theme has tweaked Bootstrap's code to support more than one level. However we do not recommend dropdown level more than one level deep.
