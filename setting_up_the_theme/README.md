7. Configuring the widgets that are displayed in the **footer widget area**.

## Adding Products

Now that we've configured the general settings of the theme, its time for the fun stuff, adding your products! But before diving into your first product you should familiarise yourself with how product categories, tags and attributes work. Read in detail about adding and managing products using **WooCommerce** here : http://docs.woothemes.com/document/managing-products/

While adding products, **MediaCenter** theme allows you to add additional information to the products. Those additional information are **Product Brands** and **Product Labels**. Read about [managing Product Brands and Product Labels]().

## Navigation

Now that you have added products to your shop and pages to your website. We need to make sure that the pages and products are accessible. For that we need to setup the navigation of the website through navigation menus.
