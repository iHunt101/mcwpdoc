# Installation

Installing the theme can be done two ways. You can upload the theme ZIP file using the built in WordPress theme upload, or copy the files through an FTP client.

*Be sure to extract the file "**mediacenter.zip**" from the ThemeForest download before uploading. Using the ThemeForest ZIP file directly will result in a "Missing Style Sheet" error.*

Once the theme is uploaded, activate it from **Appearance > Themes** by clicking the **"Activate"** link for **"MediaCenter"**.
